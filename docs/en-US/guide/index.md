## Important Notes

### Saving and Writing

In the single-song editor, search results, cover selections, lyrics processing, and ReplayGain calculations only update the editor temporarily. Changes are written to the audio file only when you tap the **Save** button.

In batch operations, tasks like **Edit Tags**, **Tag Matching**, **Rename Files**, **Format Lyrics**, and **Calculate ReplayGain** directly process the selected files. Review previews, configuration, and selection before executing.

### Deletion and Removal

**Deleting a song** or batch **Delete** removes local audio files permanently. This cannot be undone.

**Removing a folder** only removes it from Lyrico's library index. Local files are not deleted.

### Plugins and Online Search

Lyrics, covers, and online metadata are provided by plugins. Plugins must be **installed and enabled** to participate in search and batch matching. Plugin order in the management list affects search and matching priority.
